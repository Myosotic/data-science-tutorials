    "The Python philosophy is summarized in a sequence of aphorisms known as [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). It gives a great importance to code readability and to the capacity to express concepts in few lines of code. The ability to produce good code in the sense of this philosophy comes with reading and writing code, a lot of code! Anyone who wants to produce Python code has to read the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) and to deeply thinks about the advices given in this document. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library."

It means that the content of the variable has a type, not the variable itself. This is why we could assign contents from various types to x in the previous example without any trouble. In Python, the assignment of a value to a variable amounts to make the variable names pointing to a specific location in the memory which contains the value itself. This location in the memory is called an address and assigning a value with a different type to a variable simply consists in making this address pointing elsewhere in the memory.
